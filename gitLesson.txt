I am Mobin Arshad khan starting to learn git right now and i hope that i will be master in it
This is all about my text file that is going to explain the commends that i learned from the tutorials
Follwings are the tutorials that i followed:

1) Pluralsight







Commonds 
*************************************************
1) echo "Mobin Arshad khan"  or echo Mobin Arshad Khan
         Mobin Arshad khan 
        

2) mkdir directoryName (make directory)
     mkdir git

3) cd nameOfDirectory ( chane directory)
     cd git    

4) git init (initializing the git)
     git init

5) git add . (add the file to the index)  
     . represent the current( working folder ) file/folder of the project

6) git status 
      to check the status of file / folder

7) git commit -m "this is our first commits"
    it pushes the files to the repository generals means it crate the snapshot for the files 

8) git log 
      history of git files  

9) git diff 84f6c4 954d3b 
      git diff tell about the what is changed in previous commit 
      ctrl + z ( to get out from files)    
      

10) One of the most important reason to use version control system is:
      Traveling Back and fourth in time
      git checkout 4dj4e5 (to get targeted version of files)
